## Project:German Traffic sign Classifier 
 In this project I have implment a convolutional neural network based traffic sign classifier. 
 I have used mainly LeNet Atchitecture from Yann LeCun's original publication.
 
### This project compromizes of the following steps:
1. Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
2. Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
3. Design, train and test a model architecture
4. Use the model to make predictions on new images
5. Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
 

The following are the image references from the 43 different German Traffic signs available in the data set used to train test and validate the algorithm.
